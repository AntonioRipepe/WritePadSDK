### LICENSE

-   **Grant of License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, PhatWare hereby grants to Licensee a royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to use the
    Software only for development and testing of software applications
    only with the operating system specified in Exhibit B attached
    hereto, only in the location specified in Exhibit B and only for the
    term of this Agreement. Only when incorporated into an application
    developed with the Software, Licensee may make up to five (5) copies
    of the object code libraries identified in the product documentation
    as distributed components solely for internal application testing
    purposes or for direct demonstration of the application to
    prospective customers.
-   **Limitations.** Licensee shall not offer for sale, sell, license,
    sublicense, distribute or transmit such applications, the Software,
    or any portion thereof incorporated into such applications without
    obtaining the appropriate distribution license from PhatWare.
    Licensee shall not modify, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer,
    rent, lease, loan or transfer the Software. Licensee shall not make
    any copies of the Software except as necessary to use the Software
    in accordance with this Agreement.

### NONDISCLOSURE

-   **Confidential Obligations.** Licensee agrees to hold the Software and
    any features, output produced by, and other information in writing
    relating to the Software which is marked as confidential
    (collectively referred to as the "Confidential Information") in
    strict confidence for a period of two years and not to disclose the
    Confidential Information in whole or in part to any third party or
    any person other than Licensee's employees whose job performance
    requires access to the Confidential Information. Licensee will
    ensure that any person permitted access to the Confidential
    Information has signed a written non-disclosure agreement and does
    not disclose or provide the Confidential Information to others.
    Licensee agrees to employ all reasonable steps to protect the
    Confidential Information from unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure
    or unauthorized use, including but not limited to all steps that it
    takes to protect its own information that it considers proprietary
    and trade secret.
-   **Exceptions.** Licensee shall have no obligation to maintain
    confidentiality of any information which (a) is or becomes part of
    the public domain through no act or omission of Licensee; (b) was in
    Licensee's lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not
    been obtained by Licensee either directly or indirectly from
    PhatWare; (c) is lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party
    without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed
    by Licensee without use of any Confidential Information.

### WARRANTY, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

-   **Limited Software Warranty.** PhatWare warrants only to Licensee the
    following for a period of thirty (30) days after shipment: (i) the
    media on which the Software is furnished will be free of defects in
    materials and workmanship; (ii) that the Software will perform
    substantially in accordance with the functional description provided
    in the accompanying documentation. Licensee’s exclusive remedy, and
    PhatWare’s entire liability under this limited warranty, shall be,
    at PhatWare’s option, to repair or replace the Software as
    appropriate.
-   **Disclaimer.** THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH ABOVE CONSTITUTES THE
    ONLY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE. PHATWARE MAKES AND
    LICENSEE RECEIVES NO OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
    WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW)
    WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE. PHATWARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. PHATWARE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS
    ERROR-FREE OR THAT OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE SECURE OR
    UNINTERRUPTED. PHATWARE EXERCISES NO CONTROL OVER AND EXPRESSLY
    DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR OR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR
    BASED UPON VALUE OR CONTENT OF INFORMATION TRANSMITTED, OR THE
    RESULTS OR EFFECT OF SUCH TRANSMISSION, BY ANY PARTY USING THE
    SOFTWARE.
-   **Limitation of Liability.** IN NO EVENT SHALL PHATWARE BE LIABLE TO
    LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM USE
    OF THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER RESULTING FROM A TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE) BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHER FORM OF ACTION, INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL AND
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS
    AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND
    NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.
    Licensee expressly assumes all responsibility for any damages, lost
    data, lost profits and other consequential damages that may result
    in any way related to this Agreement, including without limitation,
    use of the Software.
-   **Indemnification.** PhatWare shall, at its expense, indemnify and hold
    Licensee harmless from and against any award of damages or
    PhatWare-approved settlement arising from a claim based on an
    allegation that the Software infringes a third party’s US patent or
    copyright, provided that: (i) Licensee promptly gives PhatWare
    written notice of the claim; (ii) Licensee provides all reasonable
    assistance in the defense of the claim; and (iii) PhatWare controls
    the defense or settlement of the claim. If a permanent injunction is
    obtained against the use of the Software or if, in PhatWare’s
    opinion, such an injunction is likely to be obtained, PhatWare may,
    at its sole option, obtain the right to continued use of the
    Software, substitute other equivalent software, or modify the
    Software so it is no longer infringing. The foregoing indemnity does
    not apply to any infringement claim arising if the Software: (i) has
    been modified by parties other than PhatWare; (ii) has been used in
    conjunction with other software and/or hardware which gives rise to
    an infringement claim if the use of the Software alone would not
    give rise to such infringing situation; or (iii) is other than the
    most current version if use of such current version would have
    avoided the infringing situation. **THE FOREGOING SECTION SETS FORTH
    THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF PHATWARE AND LICENSEE’S SOLE REMEDIES FOR
    INFRINGEMENT AND ALLEGATIONS OF INFRINGEMENT.**

### OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE

-   **Ownership.** Licensee acknowledges and agrees that all right, title,
    and interest in and to the Software, including without limitation

    PhatWare. Licensee further agrees that it shall not earn or
    otherwise acquire any rights or licenses under any copyrights,
    patents, trade secrets, trademarks or other intellectual property on
    account of this Agreement or Licensee's performance Exhibit
    hereunder.
-   **Assignment.** Licensee is under no obligation to make suggestions for
    change and improvement; however, if Licensee does make any such
    suggestions, Licensee agrees to promptly disclose and hereby assigns
    to PhatWare any such suggestions for change and improvement to any
    of the Software and to assist PhatWare, at PhatWare’s expense, in
